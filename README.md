# web3-site

Creating a complete web3 site would require a web framework and frontend technologies. For the sake of simplicity, I'll provide a basic example using Flask as the web framework and HTML/CSS/JS for the frontend. This example demonstrates how to check the balance of a single Ethereum wallet using a web interface.

Before proceeding, make sure you have Python installed and install Flask and web3.py using pip:
  pip install Flask
  pip install web3
  
Create a new Python file, e.g., app.py

Create a new folder named "templates" in the same directory as the "app.py" file. Inside the templates folder, create a new HTML file named "index.html"

Replace 'YOUR_INFURA_PROJECT_ID' in app.py with your actual Infura project ID.

Save all the files and run the Flask app using the following command: 
   python app.py
   
Visit http://localhost:5000 in your web browser, and you'll see the Ethereum Wallet Balance Checker web page. Enter an Ethereum wallet address, click "Check Balance," and it will display the balance of that wallet in Ether (ETH).
